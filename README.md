# Batmanlang

Batmanlang is a perfect stack based programming language (no heap == no segfault). These are its features!<br>

How to use
- git clone https://github.com/BatmanBoxer/Interpreter-in-Go
- cd interpreter-in-go
- go mod tidy
- go run cmd/main/main.go [filename].batman
  
## Exclamation Marks!
Unlike every other language which lack originality (i dont) the start of this programming langauge is from fun batman

```java
fun batman(){
  print("Hello Gotham");
}
```

1) No need for any syscalls for printing . you can do it with a simple print statement. this is revolutionart

```java
print("Hello world")
```

2) No need for multiple ways of declaring variable because its just confusing. just use var.

```java
var i = 1;
print(i)
```

3) No commets Beause if you need comment to tell you what code does just get better
4) You can create another function and call it as well

```java
fun test(){
  print("hello")
}
```
